## currentline.vim

A Vim plugin which highlights the current line by defining a new highlight group `CurrentLine`.

Use cases:

* Lost in the code; where's my cursor, where am I, hello
* Mark pen; Highlight an interesting line while doing something else so you
don't forget it

Subsequent calls will toggle the highlight:

* Remove the highlighting if called when the cursor is on an already
  highlighted line
* Add new highlighting if called when the cursor is on a
  non-highlighted line

### Installation

Throw the plugin into your `$VIMRUNTIME/plugin` directory, i.e `~/.vim/plugin/`.

### Configuration

#### Mappings

No mappings defined by default; play nice.

Here's how you can add a mapping that will toggle like described above:

```vim
nnoremap <silent> <leader>hl :call HighlightCurrentLine('â™¥')<cr>
```

#### Colors

These are the default colors, but you're expected to set it up to your own
liking in your `vimrc`:

```vim
highlight CurrentLine
  \ term=bolditalic
  \ ctermbg=184 ctermfg=bg cterm=bolditalic
  \ guibg=#1d7d70 guifg=bg gui=bold
```
